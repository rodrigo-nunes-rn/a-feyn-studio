                    <p>The main theme of this project revolves around <strong>false memories</strong>, coupled with the <strong>creation of fiction that could critically</strong> reconsider our position as students at the Faculty of Fine Arts, University of Lisbon. This reflection is made possible through the crafting of a fictional narrative, materialized in the creation of a persona (Camila) in three stages of her life. The speculative scenario is transposed into our reality through <strong>audio elements</strong>, <strong>visual components (videos and physical objects)</strong>, and digital aspects (Camilaâ€™s computer files). All elements complement each other to function in synchrony within a carefully designed <strong>Project Room</strong> experience, <strong>lasting for 15 minutes.</strong></p>

                    <h3>Why are we proud of it?</h3>
                    <p>H.C.A.T.M.W.A.T.F was a very complete and multifaceted project. Besides thorough research on a very complex topic, we had to create an immersive experience. This demanded the creation of a detailed narrative that revolved around the future of student designers through 3 different timelines. To bring this story and persona to life, we developed an experience in a physical space with physical objects synced with 3 videos and 3 different audios that had a written script read by 3 different AI voices.<br><br> Overall, this project had a lot of devices, objects, and nuances that really came to life when put together. You can see all about it on the project website.</p>
