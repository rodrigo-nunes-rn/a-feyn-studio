                    <p><em>Meu Estojo</em> is a vibrant and creative endeavor that brought Rixmiester's upbeat hip-hop track to life in unexpected ways. The music video, centered around the humorous and relatable quest to find a lost pencil case, set the tone for a larger creative initiative. Beyond the video, a full visual identity was crafted for both the artist and the song, including a personalised polo shirt and playful "lost pencil case" posters featuring QR codes that directed to the artistâ€™s page. The project culminated in a event that celebrated the release of the video, complete with a thematic exhibition featuring works from multiple artists, a live gig and DJ set, and a pop-up stand selling unique merchandise such as custom pencil cases and artwork. This multifaceted project merged music, design, and community, turning a simple song into a memorable experience.</p>

                    <h3>Why are we proud of it?</h3>
                    <p>It gave us the opportunity to work across a variety of creative mediums and collaborate with a diverse group of talented people. From designing a unique visual identity to planning an event that combined music and art, every step allowed us to explore new possibilities. What makes this project even more special is the colorful and playful universe crafted around such a humorous and lighthearted song. Bringing that vision to life in a way that resonated with audiences was both rewarding and a testament to the power of collaboration and creativity.</p>
