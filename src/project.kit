                    <h3>Why are we proud of it?</h3>
                    <p>It allowed us to bridge the worlds of design and psychology in meaningful ways, deepening our understanding of both fields. Developing this project challenged us to create a rich and dynamic database, meticulously connecting variables to ensure the results are both accurate and insightful — we’re all about finding connections. Additionally, the project pushed us to explore the exciting realm of interactive data visualisation, enabling us to present complex ideas in a captivating way. This blend of creativity and research makes Rather a project we are truly proud of.</p>
