                        <p>It allowed us to bridge the worlds of design and psychology in meaningful ways, deepening our understanding of both fields. Developing this project challenged us to create a rich and dynamic database, meticulously connecting variables to ensure the results are both accurate and insightful — we’re all about finding connections. Additionally, the project pushed us to explore the exciting realm of interactive data visualisation, enabling us to present complex ideas in a captivating way. This blend of creativity and research makes Rather a project we are truly proud of.</p>

                        <p><em>Meu Estojo</em> is a vibrant and creative endeavor that brought Rixmiester's upbeat hip-hop track to life in unexpected ways. The music video, centered around the humorous and relatable quest to find a lost pencil case, set the tone for a larger creative initiative. Beyond the video, a full visual identity was crafted for both the artist and the song, including a personalised polo shirt and playful "lost pencil case" posters featuring QR codes that directed to the artist’s page. The project culminated in a event that celebrated the release of the video, complete with a thematic exhibition featuring works from multiple artists, a live gig and DJ set, and a pop-up stand selling unique merchandise such as custom pencil cases and artwork. This multifaceted project merged music, design, and community, turning a simple song into a memorable experience.</p>

                        <p>It gave us the opportunity to work across a variety of creative mediums and collaborate with a diverse group of talented people. From designing a unique visual identity to planning an event that combined music and art, every step allowed us to explore new possibilities. What makes this project even more special is the colorful and playful universe crafted around such a humorous and lighthearted song. Bringing that vision to life in a way that resonated with audiences was both rewarding and a testament to the power of collaboration and creativity.</p>

                        <p>The main theme of this project revolves around <strong>false memories</strong>, coupled with the <strong>creation of fiction that could critically</strong> reconsider our position as students at the Faculty of Fine Arts, University of Lisbon. This reflection is made possible through the crafting of a fictional narrative, materialized in the creation of a persona (Camila) in three stages of her life. The speculative scenario is transposed into our reality through <strong>audio elements</strong>, <strong>visual components (videos and physical objects)</strong>, and digital aspects (Camila’s computer files). All elements complement each other to function in synchrony within a carefully designed <strong>Project Room</strong> experience, <strong>lasting for 15 minutes.</strong></p>

                        <p>H.C.A.T.M.W.A.T.F was a very complete and multifaceted project. Besides thorough research on a very complex topic, we had to create an immersive experience. This demanded the creation of a detailed narrative that revolved around the future of student designers through 3 different timelines. To bring this story and persona to life, we developed an experience in a physical space with physical objects synced with 3 videos and 3 different audios that had a written script read by 3 different AI voices.<br><br> Overall, this project had a lot of devices, objects, and nuances that really came to life when put together. You can see all about it on the project website.</p>
